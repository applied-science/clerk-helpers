# clerk-helpers

Helper functions for Clerk. 

Many are utilities adapted from [clojure.repl](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.repl-api.html), since in Clerk it makes less sense to print information to the REPL.

Many are used to run code from [maria.cloud](https://www.maria.cloud/) in a Clerk context.
